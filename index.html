<p ID="Lyrics">SomeBODY once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mould
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mould
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mould
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mould</p>

<p ID = Documentary> These lyrics are true beauty. Smash Mouth guitarist Greg Camp was thinking about basketball when he wrote this motivating pep song, but as soon as it was recorded, singer Steve Harwell thought about possible licensing opportunities. "We were going, 'Gatorade, football, baseball, basketball — this song's going to be everywhere.'" And soon the song was everywhere: in movies, commercials and sports arenas. While some thought bands like Led Zeppelin were selling out by having their songs in commercials around this time, Harwell never had second thoughts about the concept. "I got into this to entertain, and, of course, make a living from it, and to be able to have our music heard in whatever way." Smash Mouth’s singer Steve Harwell once fronted the white rap group F.O.S., but by 1997, when Smash Mouth debuted with Fush Yu Mang, ska-punk was the new flavour of the month. Their ‘60s-inflected ‘Walkin’ on the Sun’ crossed over onto the charts and made it #11 in the 1997 triple j Hottest 100, just two places below ‘Karma Police’. However, by the time the followup – 1999’s Astro Lounge – arrived Smash Mouth had abandoned all pretenses to being a credible rock band.
At the time, SPIN called them “a goofy but deeply schooled popcore band who sing about getting blunted and nodding off on the American Dream like a bunch of stoner Smurfs”. Their lack of seriousness was their appeal, and ‘All Star’ was the crown jewel. Where the New Radicals’ ‘You Get What You Give‘ combined cynicism, earnestness and a fuck-you end verse into – seriously – one of the greatest songs of the ‘90s, ‘All Star’ was the corporate-rock novelty version. But it was involuntarily catchy, and parents liked it as much as their kids. Soon, Smash Mouth were soundtracking montages in Shrek, Digimon: The Movie, Mystery Men, Rat Race, Inspector Gadget, and apparently every other movie ever made. As soon as it was recorded, singer Steve Harwell was thinking about about licensing opportunities. “We were going, ‘Gatorade, football, baseball, basketball — this song’s going to be everywhere,’” he told Rolling Stone. He was right, but they were too successful. By 2003, the dream was over. In a more cynical time, Smash Mouth became the goofy ‘90s relic we’d prefer to forget.
But years later, once we were far removed enough from the ‘90s to mock them, the Smash Mouth renaissance began. Patient zero: a 2010 Saturday Night Live sketch where “Smash Mouth” keep emerging from a young girl’s closet to play ‘All Star’ at her. In 2011: the “Smash Mouth eat the eggs“ incident, where Twitterer Jon Hendren, a.k.a. @fart, successfully raises $10,000 for charity to get Steve Harwell to eat two dozen eggs, cooked by his celebrity chef doppelganger Guy Fieri.
Our generation is doomed, and all we can do is quote the lyrics of ‘All Star’ in increasingly absurd settings
But it’s Neil Cicierega’s 2014 mashup album Mouth Sounds that takes things to the next level. Cicierega combines Smash Mouth with everything from Modest Mouse to the Full House theme, even John Lennon – all to horrifying effect. Mouth Sounds was the peak of the internet’s obsession with nostalgia and BuzzFeed quizzes, where everything uncool from our youth collides and forms a black hole that sucks in everything else. Smash Mouth’s ‘All Star’ is the gaping void at its centre. In other words: Nostalgia is the death of original art, our generation is doomed, and all we can do is quote the lyrics of ‘All Star’ in increasingly absurd settings. </p>
